## Introduction

Cryptocurrency trading is a rapidly growing market. With its volatility, predicting price movements can be a daunting task. This project aims to simplify that by using machine learning techniques to analyze historical price data. By doing so, we hope to provide insights that can help traders make informed decisions.

## Features

- **Machine Learning Models**: Utilizes various machine learning algorithms to predict prices.
- **Blockchain Integration**: Ensures data integrity and transparency.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Designed for easy navigation and usage.
- **Real-Time Predictions**: Offers up-to-date price forecasts.
- **Historical Data Analysis**: Analyzes past price movements for better predictions.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Languages**: JavaScript, Python
- **Frameworks**: TensorFlow, Flask
- **Blockchain Technology**: Ethereum, Solidity
- **Data Visualization**: Matplotlib, Plotly
- **APIs**: CoinGecko API for real-time data

## Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/HarshBirari/crypto-price-prediction.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
   ```bash
   cd crypto-price-prediction
   ```

3. **Install the required dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Set up the blockchain environment** (if applicable):
   - Ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed.
   - Install Truffle:
     ```bash
     npm install -g truffle
     ```

5. **Compile the smart contracts**:
   ```bash
   truffle compile
   ```

6. **Deploy the smart contracts**:
   ```bash
   truffle migrate
   ```

## Usage

After installation, you can start the application by running the following command:

```bash
python app.py
```

Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000` to access the application. From there, you can input historical data and view predicted prices.

## Data Sources

This project relies on various data sources for historical cryptocurrency prices. We primarily use the CoinGecko API for fetching real-time and historical data.
